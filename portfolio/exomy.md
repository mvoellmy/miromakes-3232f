ExoMy is an open source, fully 3D printed rover, that I developed together with Maximilian Ehrhardt during my two years of working in the Planetary Robotics Laboratory at the European Space Agency.

When working on ExoMy, it was important to build an online presence as well as a community around the open source project. A discord server was set up where people from all around the world could chat about their progress, problems and new solutions revolving around ExoMy.

The project resulted in a [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344874558_ExoMy_A_Low_Cost_3D_Printed_Rover) at i-SAIRAS 2020 as well as a [poster](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345162193_ExoMy_An_Open_Source_3D_Printed_Rover_for_Education) which was presented at the Workshop on Planetary Robotics at IROS 2020.
