My [Blackstar HT-5R MkII](https://www.blackstaramps.com/uk/ranges/ht-5r-mkii) guitar amplifier, does not have a master volume. Meaning, if I want to play louder, I have to change the volumes of **both** the clean **and** the overdrive channel. Not really a big deal, but when playing with other people, it is handy to be able to adjust both channels at once.

As the amplifier does have an effects loop it is possible to build a pseudo master volume. The goal was to build a master volume that is highly integrated into the amp and does not feel out of place.

A 3D printed "extension-plug" is added to the effects loop return in order to regulate the volume using the potentiometer installed on the amps control panel.
